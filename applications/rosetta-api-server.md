## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** Build Rosetta API service
- **Brief Description:** Parsing actions and matching data in Rosetta API standard for other Antelope integration developers' convenience.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:**  This integration would hugely help other engineers (especially in exchanges) to build dApps, and the Antelope ecosystem to be broaden
- **Reason for Interest:** We want to contribute to the infrastructure building field, and Rosetta API support is the best fit for us, full of backend developers

### Project Details

- Build a collector and parser for Antelope's transactions and store our dedicated RDB with keeping txs' history
  - Allow many APIs to support historical data lookup, which off-chain RDB processing is inevitable.
  - We can cover both gRPC and REST connection (prefer gRPC)
- Data source
  - Build from public snapshots of the data depot
  - Use the public endpoint of BPs'.
- Implement the Rosetta server following its API specification
  - Language: Golang on [`rosetta-sdk-go`](https://github.com/coinbase/rosetta-sdk-go)
- Maintain the infrastructure for operation. (Publicize our API server & endpoint)
- Documentation & developer support

Please check our similar works stated in Additional information.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Lowering the barrier to entry for developers
  - Who: Anyone who does not have to know the whole specification of Antelope
  - How: Provide the APIs they already know and have integrated before, eliminating the need to learn Antelope-specific API.
  - Where would be good: Exchange developer, Blockchain statistics application (CoinGecko, CMC, etc.), Multichain bridging project, etc.

## Development Status

7 developers (1 FE, 1 data, 5 BE & system) and 1 product designer are working at DELIGHT LABS. We have full experience in Cosmos SDK projects - both validation & dApp building. Especially, we validate 10+ projects, including Terra classic, Terra 2.0, ORBS, Xpla, Oasis protocol, Fetch.ai, Findora, Casperlabs, SSV, Rizon, Medibloc, and so on, and we build & operate 1st dApp and AMM DEX - Terraswap on both of Terra classic & 2.0.

As mentioned above, we have enough experience in the blockchain industry, and now we have started to expand our area to Antelope, which is our homeland. With not only our blockchain core experience but also enough knowledge in CS background, we will contribute to and build a strong basis on the Antelope ecosystem.

## Future Plans

- Once the API server is deployed, we will operate with code upgrade for at least a year. Moreover, we will support bugfix for enough years.
- Currently, very few EOSIO-based tokens are listed on CEXes. But we hope many Antelope-based tokens would be listed as easily as ERC20. Native tokens as well as others would be supported equally on `/account/balance`.
- We will also influence our works and give much help to relayers from/to Antelope to check Tx state tracking.

## Additional Information

- Our similar reference - [Cosmwasm-ETL](https://github.com/DELIGHT-LABS/cosmwasm-etl) (private, building)
  - For unifying data processing codes to cover all DELIGHT LABS' DEXes built on Cosmwasm-based projects
  - Collector: Tx stores on AWS S3
  - Parser: JSON tx parsing into DTO, and store into DB
  - Aggregator: process RDB for providing personal stats
  - Provide data service on Graphql
  - UI implementation: [Terraswap dashboard on Terra classic](https://app-classic.terraswap.io/)
