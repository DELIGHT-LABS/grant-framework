## Project Overview

### Overview

- **Name:** Research for building Rust Antelope CDT
- **Brief Description:** Prior to building Rust Antelope CDT, we want to check the cost effective plan among the cases we thought.
- **Relationship to EOSIO:** More than C++, many developers using other languages could access & come into Antelope ecosystem and become to be an Antelope builder. We set the first target to Rust.
- **Reason for Interest:** We want to contribute in non-token area, like infrastructure. As our past experience of building on EOSIO, it run so fast but it seemed that few developers can understand and be a builder. C++ was essential language 10+ years ago, but the trend moves as time goes by. For making bigger builder pool, modern language support & language diversity are essential.

### Project Details

Prior to building Rust Antelope CDT, we want to check these 2 parts and expected direction to implement:

1. Sufficient compatibility between EOS VM and wasm binary from [Wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer)-based compiler
    - Rust `antelope.cdt` API implementation
1. Lack of compatibility between EOS VM and wasm binary from [Wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer)-based compiler exists
    - Devleoping compiler first -> Rust `antelope.cdt` API implementation
    - Or Wasmer VM integration on Antelope

As the following plan is quite different among each case, we decided to devide the research proposal.

### Ecosystem Fit

By this implementation, Antelope can broad to one more contract language, Rust. And this would be the basis to broad to more language ecosystem. As recently WASM can be made from Golang and Javascript, we look forward Antelope to cover more popular language users.

```

NOTE: There is no official general Rust LLVM. [This standardization project](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/llvm/) is still in incubation status.

**Assumptions**: For cost-effective building, we want to build from the many works of [Wasmer](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer), although Antelope doesn't need to mount Wamser.

#### Cases

1. If `IR ≅ IR'` and `API ≅ API'`
    - We can directly start from Wasmer's implementation
      - Implement Antelope-specific data structure and API of `eosio.cdt` (Like table, vector, and etc)
1. Else if `IR ≅ IR'` and `API != API'`
    - Implement a compiler first, which works for adjusting WASM API interface from Wasmer spec to EOSVM spec
    - Aftern then, do (1)
1. Else (`IR != IR'` and `API != API'`)
    - Mounting Wasmer on Antelope would be the cheapest
    - Mounting Wasmer with the existing state DB compabilization, and do (1)
    - [Draft proposal of this case](https://github.com/DELIGHT-LABS/grant-framework/blob/docs/wasmer-integration/applications/wasmer-integration.md)

### Why Wasmer?

Performance is placed in the top tier. [benchmark 2021](https://00f.net/2021/02/22/webassembly-runtimes-benchmarks/) And it has the biggest ecosystem among WASM VM. This project supports many languages accordingly.
