## Development Status

7 developers (1 FE, 1 data, 5 BE & system) and 1 product designer are working in DELIGHT LABS. We had full experience in Cosmos SDK projects - both of validation & dApp building. Especially, we validate 10+ projects including Terra classic, Terra 2.0, ORBS, Xpla, Oasis protocol, Fetch.ai, Findora, Casperlabs, SSV, Rizon, Medibloc, and so on, and we build & operate 1st dApp and AMM DEX - Terraswap on both of Terra classic & 2.0.

As like mentioned above, our team has enough experience in blochchain industry, and now we start to expand our area to Antelope(and come back to our homeland). With not only our blockchain core experience but also enough knowledge in CS background, we will contribute and build strong basis on Antelope ecosystem.
